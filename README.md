# Subtraction
 The program calculates the subtraction of one positive integer from another in any number system.
   Notes
       – Each number must be no more than 50 characters
       – The program detects a larger number, subtracts the second from it, and depending on whether the first or second number is larger, a minus is put in the output result
       – An additional array called Alp (Alphabet) is used for calculations    
       – If the user accidentally enters a character that is not included in the specified number system, the program destroys it and outputs it along with the result
